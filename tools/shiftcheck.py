"""Finds the addresses that would not follow the code if it moved.

    shiftcheck.py [-v VERSION] [--all [--numbers]] [--update] [--strict] [--base REV] [ELF...]

A build is shiftable when every address in its code and data is a symbol:
then adding or removing bytes anywhere still links into a working game. The
build links every binary with --emit-relocs, which keeps a relocation on each
word the linker filled in (build/<version>/*.elf). Whatever holds an address
but has no relocation, or has one against an absolute symbol, stays put when
the code moves:

  word     a word of data that holds an address without an R_MIPS_32: a
           number in C, a `.word 0x8...` that splat didn't symbolize, a
           pointer in a u32 table. Only a value at a label (or at a string
           in a block of rodata) counts: the rest of the words in the range
           are numbers (sound ids, pixels), which --all --numbers lists
  lui      a lui of an address's upper half without an R_MIPS_HI16 (a
           lui/ori pair makes a number, not an address)
  jal      a j/jal to an address without an R_MIPS_26
  abs      a relocation against an absolute symbol in RAM that the binary
           doesn't get from the binaries it links with (the executable, its
           parent overlay, its children): splat's undefined_syms_auto entries and the
           addresses in the symbol files, which the linker never moves.
           `own` when the address is inside the binary (a label that is
           missing), `other` when it is in another binary
  header   a word of the executable's header

RAM is 0x80010000-0x801FFF00: the kernel's below and the stack above are
fixed by the hardware. The memory map's addresses (the *_VRAM of
mk/version/<version>.mk, where the overlays load) are fixed by design.

config/<version>/shiftcheck.txt lists what is known and left to fix by
address: the binary, the address of the word or the instruction and the
address it holds, with the names after a #, which a rename doesn't make
stale. The script exits with 1 on anything it doesn't list, and warns about
what it lists that is fixed (fails, with --strict). --update rewrites it.
The list may only get shorter: --base fails on an entry that the list of the
git revision REV doesn't have (the CI's is the parent commit, which for a
pull request is the base branch's).
