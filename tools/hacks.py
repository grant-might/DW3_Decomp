"""Count the workarounds the matched C needs, by the markers they carry, and
fail on what the source must never have.

    tools/hacks.py                  the counts; fails on forbidden code
    tools/hacks.py --list           every one, with its file, line and function
    tools/hacks.py --check FILE...  also fail if the badge or the table,
                                    wherever they are in these files, differs

Every spot where the C only matches through a form natural C wouldn't take
carries a comment that says so. This finds them in src/ and include/:

- fake matches: a comment that starts with "fake match:", the last resort,
  a form forced only for the codegen;
- BEC forms: a comment that starts with "BEC form:", a form the rules take
  nowhere else, allowed as a one-off exception for one of the last
  functions because another matched decomp's source has it;
- unused frame locals: a local the code never uses, kept because the
  original's stack frame has room for it, marked with exactly
  /* unused, but it is in the original stack frame */
- form-dependent matches: a comment that says "match depends on", where the
  match needs one of several equivalent forms (a statement macro's
  do-while, an extra block, braces left out, a copy of a variable, a type,
  one version's own form of a loop);
- functions still in assembly: INCLUDE_ASM lines.

The badge in README.md shows the fake matches, then the other three kinds
together, and the table in docs/status.md each count (--check README.md
docs/status.md). The functions still in assembly are counted apart, and
--list also shows what is assembly without being a hack: the rodata still
behind INCLUDE_RODATA, the data written as top-level asm (padding that the
original objects have) and the macros that wrap inline asm for what C can't
say (moving $sp to the scratchpad, GTE instructions).

A function either matches as C or stays behind its INCLUDE_ASM, so these
always fail:

- NON_MATCHING (or NONMATCHING) code, and #if 0 blocks: C that doesn't
  match, or a draft, doesn't belong in src/;
- inline asm written in a function's body, a register variable pinned with
  asm("$reg"), or a top-level asm that isn't data: assembly in place of C.
