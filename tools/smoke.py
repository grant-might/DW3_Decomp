"""Boots a build in DuckStation and checks that the game reaches its first menu.

    VERSION=<version> smoke.py --disc IMAGE --bios DIR [--pad PAD]
                               [--emulator DUCKSTATION]

`make smoke` runs it: an optional check, on your machine only, that the
build boots. It writes the build (build/<version>, or the padding build's
build/<version>/pad<pad>) into a copy of the original disc image
(tools/patch_disc.py), boots that in DuckStation under xvfb-run, with no
window, and reads GAME.mode through DuckStation's GDB server until the game
waits in the first screen that needs a button: the title screen (USA) or the
language menu (Europe). Then it watches the game for HOLD seconds: it passes
if the game takes no exception that the kernel leaves unresolved (all but
interrupts and system calls), never jumps to 0, runs only known code (the
BIOS, the kernel, the build's binaries), keeps drawing frames and stays in
that screen, with the code of one of the build's mode overlays where the
executable loads them. A padding build moves every binary, so a pass with
PAD=0x10004 means that the code and data that moved still work.

DuckStation runs with HOME in build/.../smoke/home, so that it reads the
settings written there and never yours, nor your memory cards. It reads the
BIOS from DIR and writes nothing there. It is stopped through its process
group, whatever happens.
