"""Give the common symbols of a compiled object the alignment of a word.

maspsx writes a static variable of a -G8 unit as `.comm X,size` (Makefile:
SDATA_LIMIT), so that it resolves to its definition in src/main/data, and
leaves its alignment to the assembler, which takes it from the size: 8 for
system.c's 8-byte BOOT_IMAGE_RECT. The definitions are only word-aligned,
as the original linker laid them (the European BOOT_IMAGE_RECT is at
0x8005CCB4), and ld warns about the difference. This writes
`.comm X,size,4` for a common larger than a word; the bytes of the object
don't change, only its symbol table.
